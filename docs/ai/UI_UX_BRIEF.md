## 1. Design thesis

> **Enterprise software should feel like a good tool, not like a compliance obligation.**

Every incumbent ERP loses on interface. SAP is dense and hostile. NetSuite looks like 2009.
Odoo is friendly but visually inconsistent between modules. ERPNext is constrained by its
framework. **UX is our most winnable competitive front**, and it is won by consistency far more
than by decoration.

### The five design laws

| Law                             | Meaning in practice                                                                                                                          |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Clarity beats cleverness** | A user should never wonder what a control does. No mystery-meat icons, no ambiguous labels, no invented metaphors.                           |
| **2. Density with air**         | Professionals need data on screen. We achieve it with a tight type scale and disciplined spacing — not by removing whitespace.               |
| **3. Consistency is a feature** | Learning one module must teach you all 45. Identical patterns, identical positions, identical vocabulary.                                    |
| **4. Calm by default**          | Colour carries meaning, never decoration. A screen with nothing wrong is quiet. Saturation is reserved for things that need attention.       |
| **5. Speed is design**          | Perceived performance is a design property. Skeletons match the final layout; optimistic updates are the default; nothing shifts after load. |

### Applied HCI principles

- **Hick's Law** — fewer visible choices. Primary action prominent, secondary actions in an
  overflow menu, tertiary actions in the command palette only.
- **Fitts's Law** — the most frequent target is the largest and closest. Mobile targets ≥ 44 px.
- **Miller's Law** — group into 5–7 items. Long forms become sections; long menus become groups.
- **Jakob's Law** — behave like the software users already know. Standard conventions beat
  original ones every time.
- **Progressive disclosure** — the common path is on screen; the advanced path is one click away.

## 2. Tokens are the law

**Every visual value comes from a token.** A literal hex colour, a literal pixel value, or a
literal font size in application code is a **build failure**, enforced by a CI gate.

```
❌  color: #6366f1;      padding: 16px;      font-size: 14px;
✅  color: var(--color-primary);  padding: var(--space-4);  font-size: var(--text-sm);
```

Tokens live in `@kannan19302/ui-tokens` and ship as CSS custom properties. Themes swap the values;
component code never changes.

**Themes:** `meridian` / `meridian-dark` (§13 — the design language; the target default for
every platform) · `light` (current package default) · `dark` · `enterprise` · `modern` ·
`minimal` · `classic` · `high-contrast`.
**Density:** `comfortable` (default) · `compact` — orthogonal to theme, applied via
`[data-density]`, and a user preference.

---

## 3. Colour

> **Amended 2026-08-21.** §3 documents the `light` theme, which is still shipped and still the
> package default. It is no longer the brand: **Meridian (§13) is the design language**, its
> primary is a deep teal rather than indigo, and its values supersede the tables below on any
> surface that has adopted it. The *rules* in §3.4 and §3.5 apply unchanged to every theme.

### 3.1 Semantic surfaces (light theme — the reference)

| Token                 | Value              | Use                                                                                 |
| :-------------------- | :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--color-bg`          | `#fafbfc`          | Page background. Deliberately off-white — pure white fatigues in an 8-hour workday. |
| `--color-bg-elevated` | `#ffffff`          | Cards, modals, dropdowns, table surfaces                                            |
| `--color-bg-sunken`   | `#f1f3f5`          | Wells, table headers, inset regions                                                 |
| `--color-bg-hover`    | `#f1f3f5`          | Row and control hover                                                               |
| `--color-bg-active`   | `#e9ecef`          | Pressed / selected                                                                  |
| `--color-bg-overlay`  | `rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5)` | Modal scrim                                                                         |

### 3.2 Borders and text

| Token                    | Value     | Use                                                        |
| :----------------------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--color-border`         | `#e2e8f0` | Default separators — **soft, never harsh**                 |
| `--color-border-strong`  | `#cbd5e1` | Inputs, emphasised boundaries                              |
| `--color-border-focus`   | `#6366f1` | Focus ring (always visible, never removed)                 |
| `--color-text`           | `#1a1a2e` | Primary. Near-black with a blue cast — softer than `#000`. |
| `--color-text-secondary` | `#555b67` | Labels, supporting copy                                    |
| `--color-text-tertiary`  | `#6b7280` | Metadata, timestamps, placeholders                         |
| `--color-text-link`      | `#6366f1` | Links                                                      |

### 3.3 Brand and status

| Role        | Token             | Value              | Meaning — used for nothing else                                                                                                                              |
| :---------- | :---------------- | :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary** | `--color-primary` | `#6366f1` (indigo) | The single brand accent. Primary actions, active nav, focus. Chosen because indigo reads as trustworthy and technical without the "every SaaS product" blue. |
| **Success** | `--color-success` | `#10b981`          | Completed, approved, posted, paid, in stock                                                                                                                  |
| **Warning** | `--color-warning` | `#f59e0b`          | Pending, expiring, low stock, needs attention                                                                                                                |
| **Danger**  | `--color-danger`  | `#f43f5e`          | Failed, rejected, overdue, destructive action                                                                                                                |
| **Info**    | `--color-info`    | `#0ea5e9`          | Neutral system information, tips                                                                                                                             |

Each status carries a four-part ramp: `-light` (background fill), base (border/icon),
`-hover`, and `-text` (accessible foreground on the light fill). **Status pills always use the
`-light` background with `-text` foreground** — never a saturated fill with white text, which
makes a busy list page shout.

### 3.4 Charts

Ten sequential tokens `--chart-1` … `--chart-10`, ordered so that adjacent series are
distinguishable in both light and dark themes **and under deuteranopia and protanopia**. Never
hand-pick a chart colour; never re-order the ramp per chart. Semantic status colours may be
used in a chart only when the series genuinely means that status.

### 3.5 Colour rules

1. Colour is never the sole carrier of meaning — always pair with an icon, label, or position.
2. Contrast: **4.5:1** for body text, **3:1** for large text and UI boundaries (WCAG 2.2 AA).
   `high-contrast` theme targets AAA.
3. No gradients in functional UI. Marketing surfaces may use them; the product does not.
4. A screen in a normal state uses primary + neutrals only. If a page is full of colour,
   something is wrong with the design, not the data.

## 4. Typography

| Token         | Size | Line height | Use                                             |
| :------------ | :--- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| `--text-xs`   | 12px | 1.5         | Metadata, table captions, badges                |
| `--text-sm`   | 14px | 1.5         | **The workhorse.** Body, tables, forms, labels. |
| `--text-base` | 16px | 1.6         | Long-form reading, empty-state copy             |
| `--text-lg`   | 18px | 1.5         | Card titles, section headings                   |
| `--text-xl`   | 20px | 1.4         | Page subsections                                |
| `--text-2xl`  | 24px | 1.3         | Page titles                                     |
| `--text-3xl`  | 30px | 1.2         | Dashboard KPI figures                           |
| `--text-4xl`  | 36px | 1.1         | Marketing hero only — not used in the product   |

**Families**

- `--font-sans`: `Inter` → `Segoe UI` → `system-ui` → `-apple-system`. Inter is chosen for its
  tall x-height (legible at 14px), its **tabular figures**, and its open-source SIL licence.
- `--font-mono`: `JetBrains Mono` → `Fira Code` → `Consolas`. Codes, IDs, hashes, JSON.

**Rules**

1. **All numerals in tables, ledgers, and totals use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.**
   Non-aligned digits in a financial column is a defect, not a preference.
2. Weights: 400 body · 500 labels and table headers · 600 headings · 700 KPI figures only.
   Never 300 or lighter — it fails at 14px on a low-DPI office monitor.
3. Sentence case everywhere. Not Title Case, never ALL CAPS except a ≤ 4-character badge.
4. Measure: 60–75 characters for prose. Full width for tables.
5. Never centre body text. Never justify.

---

## 5. Spacing and layout

### 5.1 The 4px grid

Every dimension is a multiple of 4. `--space-1` = 4px through `--space-24` = 96px, with half
steps at `--space-0.5` (2px), `--space-1.5` (6px), and `--space-2.5` (10px) for fine control.

| Context                | Token                     | Value    |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------ | :------- |
| Icon ↔ label           | `--space-2`               | 8px      |
| Inside a form field    | `--space-2` / `--space-3` | 8 / 12px |
| Between fields         | `--space-4`               | 16px     |
| Card padding           | `--space-6`               | 24px     |
| Between cards          | `--space-4`               | 16px     |
| Between sections       | `--space-8`               | 32px     |
| Page padding (desktop) | `--space-6`               | 24px     |
| Page padding (mobile)  | `--space-4`               | 16px     |

Compact density scales these down one step; it does not change the grid.

### 5.2 Structure

| Element           | Value                                                           |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sidebar           | 260px expanded · 64px collapsed                                 |
| Top bar           | 56px, sticky                                                    |
| Content max width | 1440px for forms and reading; full-bleed for data tables        |
| Breakpoints       | `sm` 640 · `md` 768 · `lg` 1024 · `xl` 1280 · `2xl` 1536        |
| Table row         | 44px comfortable · 36px compact                                 |
| Control height    | 36px default · 32px small · 44px large (and all mobile targets) |

### 5.3 Radius and elevation

Radii: `sm` 4px (badges, small controls) · `md` 6px (**inputs and buttons — the default**) ·
`lg` 8px (cards) · `xl` 12px (modals) · `2xl` 16px (marketing) · `full` (avatars, pills).

Elevation is a five-step scale (`--elevation-1` … `--elevation-5`) built from low-opacity
slate shadows — **soft, never dark**. Rule: resting cards use elevation 1–2; hovering a card
raises it to `--elevation-hover`; dropdowns 3; modals 4; toasts 5. Never stack a border and a
heavy shadow on the same element.

---

## 6. Motion

| Token               | Value                          | Use                                            |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `--duration-fast`   | 100ms                          | Hover, focus, colour change                    |
| `--duration-normal` | 200ms                          | **Default.** Dropdowns, tooltips, tab switches |
| `--duration-slow`   | 300ms                          | Modals, drawers, page transitions              |
| `--duration-slower` | 500ms                          | Celebratory / onboarding moments only          |
| `--ease-default`    | `cubic-bezier(.4,0,.2,1)`      | Almost everything                              |
| `--ease-out`        | `cubic-bezier(0,0,.2,1)`       | Entering the screen                            |
| `--ease-in`         | `cubic-bezier(.4,0,1,1)`       | Leaving the screen                             |
| `--ease-spring`     | `cubic-bezier(.34,1.56,.64,1)` | Toast entry, success confirmation — sparingly  |

**Rules:** motion communicates _where something came from_, nothing else. Animate only
`transform` and `opacity`. Never animate layout properties. Never animate a data table's rows.
**`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables all non-essential motion** — this is mandatory,
not optional.

---

## 7. Component conventions

### Buttons

| Variant   | Use                        | Rule                                                                      |
| :-------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Primary   | The one main action        | **Exactly one per view.** Two primaries means the hierarchy is undecided. |
| Secondary | Alternative actions        | Bordered, transparent background                                          |
| Ghost     | Toolbar and inline actions | No border until hover                                                     |
| Danger    | Destructive                | Always paired with a typed confirmation                                   |
| Link      | Navigation styled as text  | —                                                                         |

Order is always `[Cancel] [Confirm]` — destructive never gets the default focus. A button that
triggers async work shows an inline spinner _and_ stays disabled until resolution.

### Forms

Labels above fields, always (never placeholder-as-label). Required marked with `*` plus an
`aria-required`. Help text below the field in `--text-xs`/tertiary. Errors below, in danger
colour, **with an icon**, and stated as what to do (`"Enter a date on or after the invoice
date"`) — not what went wrong. Validate on blur, re-validate on change once errored.

### Tables

The shared `DataTable` from `@kannan19302/ui` is mandatory — hand-rolled `<table>` markup in a page
is a review rejection. Sticky header. Zebra striping off by default (borders are enough at our
row height). Numeric columns right-aligned with tabular figures. Sort via the shared
`.dt-sort-th` / `.dt-sort-arrow` convention only. Server-side pagination always.

### Status pills

`--radius-full`, `--text-xs`, weight 500, `-light` background, `-text` foreground, a 6px dot in
the base colour. Always the same colour for the same status **across every module**.

### Feedback

| Type         | Use                                                                                          |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Toast        | Transient success/failure. Top-right, 4s, stackable, with Undo where reversible.             |
| Inline alert | Persistent, contextual, in the flow of the page                                              |
| Modal        | Only when the user must decide before continuing. Never for information.                     |
| Drawer       | Detail or edit without losing list context. Preferred over a modal for anything with a form. |
| Banner       | Page- or system-level state (trial expiring, degraded service, offline)                      |

### Empty states

Always: a light illustration, a one-sentence explanation of what belongs here, and the primary
action. Never a bare "No data".

## 8. Accessibility — non-negotiable

Target: **WCAG 2.2 AA on every shipped screen.**

- Every interactive element is keyboard reachable, in a logical order, with a **visible focus
  ring** (`--color-border-focus`, 2px, 2px offset). Removing focus outlines is forbidden.
- Semantic HTML first; ARIA only where semantics genuinely fall short.
- Every icon-only button has an `aria-label`. Every image has meaningful `alt` or `alt=""`.
- Modals trap focus, close on `Esc`, and return focus to the trigger.
- Live regions announce async results (toasts, validation summaries, save confirmations).
- Forms: `<label for>` on every input; errors linked with `aria-describedby`;
  `aria-invalid` on failure.
- Colour contrast verified automatically in CI (axe) and manually per release.
- Fully usable at 200% browser zoom and at 320px viewport width.

## 9. Responsive and platform

| Surface                 | Approach                                                                                 |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Desktop web ≥ 1024      | Full sidebar, multi-column, dense tables                                                 |
| Tablet 768–1023         | Collapsed sidebar, 2-column forms, tables scroll horizontally in their own container     |
| Mobile web < 768        | Bottom nav, single column, **tables become card lists** — never a pinch-zoomed table     |
| Native mobile (Flutter) | Same tokens, platform-native navigation and gestures. Offline-first. Targets ≥ 44px.     |
| Desktop (Tauri)         | The web app plus native menus, keyboard shortcuts, notifications, and file-system access |

**Rule:** the page body never scrolls horizontally. Wide content (tables, charts, code) scrolls
inside its own `overflow-x: auto` container.

---

## 10. What we do not do

- ❌ Copy any incumbent ERP's visual language. We are not a Frappe/SAP/Odoo skin.
- ❌ Decorative icons. Every icon earns its place by aiding recognition.
- ❌ Hardcoded colours or pixel values in application code.
- ❌ Inline styles for layout or form structure.
- ❌ Ad-hoc components. If it does not exist in `@kannan19302/ui-*`, add it _there_ — with a
  Storybook entry — rather than locally in a page.

## 11. Platform identity — eleven anatomies

> Amended 2026-08-21. The previous version of this section listed a **density**
> per platform and nothing else. That was not an identity: density is one token
> axis, and every platform that consumed the design system still drew the same
> shape — left sidebar, top bar, page header, card grid. §12 diagnosed exactly
> this failure one altitude down ("thirteen builders shared tokens and still
> looked like thirteen products, because **layout** was the part that was
> diverging") and fixed it with a frame. This section applies the same reasoning
> in the opposite direction: the platforms need layouts that deliberately
> diverge, and one element that deliberately does not.

**A platform's anatomy is determined by its persona's session, not by its team.**
A user who is on a screen for fifteen seconds and a user who is on it for eight
hours do not want the same frame, and giving them the same frame is how one of
them gets a bad one.

| # | Surface | Persona · session | Anatomy |
| :-- | :------ | :---------------- | :------ |
| 1 | **Global Platform Wizard** (:4000) | any signed-in user · ~15s | **No chrome.** No sidebar, no top bar, no page header. A full-bleed centred field of platform plates. The only in-product screen permitted a hero. Type-to-filter, `Enter` to launch. |
| 2 | **Marketing Site** (P1) | anonymous buyer · minutes | **Editorial.** Asymmetric grid, full-bleed alternating bands, display type at sizes that appear nowhere else, and a motion budget the product does not get. Its `/admin` CMS uses anatomy 4, not this one. |
| 3 | **Tenant Applications** (P3) | business user · 8h/day | **Flexible columns.** Module rail → list → detail → inspector, sliding, never losing context. Record pages are object pages with anchor nav. Comfortable density. |
| 4 | **Tenant Admin Console** (P6) | tenant admin · minutes, infrequent | **Index/detail settings.** Searchable left index over the setting tabs; the right pane is always a form; a sticky dirty-state footer is pinned to the bottom. No dashboard, no KPI row. Deliberately the inverse of anatomy 3. |
| 5 | **Application Wizard** (in P3) | business user · ~10s | **A shelf, not a hero.** The same plate component as anatomy 1 at a smaller scale, bounded inside the tenant shell. The two wizards must never be interchangeable, and scale is what enforces it. |
| 6 | **Provider Admin OS** (P2) | internal staff · monitoring | **Ops console.** Icon rail + horizontal domain bar + an always-present live status strip + a bottom console drawer. Compact by default, tables full-bleed. Control-plane work is watching work; the layout says so. |
| 7 | **Marketplace** (P7) | buyer/installer · browsing | **Storefront.** Faceted filter rail + gallery + a listing built like a product page (imagery, permissions manifest, changelog, install CTA). The widest gutters in the product. |
| 8 | **Developer Platform** (P8) | maker · hours | **Workspace + Studio.** `PlatformShell` → `WorkspaceShell` → `StudioShell`. §12's four rules are unchanged and still gated. Chrome recedes; canvas ≥ 60% at 1280px. |
| 9 | **Tenant Websites** (P4) | the tenant's own customer | **No UniERP chrome, by design.** We contribute the block contract and typographic rhythm only; the tenant's brand tokens override everything visible. |
| 10 | **Mobile** (P9) | field user · bursts | **Bottom nav, sheet-first.** Tables become card lists, the inspector becomes a bottom sheet. Targets ≥ 44px. |
| 11 | **Desktop** (P10) | power user | **Native chrome merge.** Titlebar integration, native menus, and one global ⌘K that spans platforms rather than restarting per app. |

### 11.0 The shells that implement this

| Anatomy | Component | Ships from |
| :------ | :-------- | :--------- |
| 1 · no chrome | `LaunchShell` (`variant="hero"`) | `@kannan19302/ui/shell` |
| 2 · editorial | `EditorialShell` + `EditorialBand` | `@kannan19302/ui/shell` |
| 3 · flexible columns | `RecordShell` + `ObjectPage` | `@kannan19302/ui/shell` |
| 4 · index/detail settings | `SettingsShell` | `@kannan19302/ui/shell` |
| 5 · a shelf | `LaunchShell` (`variant="shelf"`) | `@kannan19302/ui/shell` |
| 6 · ops console | `OpsShell` | `@kannan19302/ui/shell` |
| 7 · storefront | `CatalogShell` + `CatalogGallery` + `CatalogListing` | `@kannan19302/ui/shell` |
| 8 · workspace + studio | `PlatformShell` · `WorkspaceShell` · `StudioShell` | `@kannan19302/ui/shell`, `/studio` |
| 9 · tenant-branded | block registry only — no shell by design | `tenant-sites` |
| 10 · bottom nav, sheet-first | Flutter `app_shell.dart` | `unierp-mobile` |
| 11 · native chrome | Tauri wrapper around 3 and 8 | `desktop-app` |

Anatomies 1 and 5 are **one component with two scales** on purpose. The two
wizards must never be interchangeable, and the thing that actually prevents a
user confusing them is not that they live in two files — it is that one fills
the viewport and the other sits inside a page. `launch-shell.test.tsx` asserts
the type scale genuinely differs, so the distinction cannot be lost in a
refactor.

**A dimension used by more than one shell is a token.** Four sidebar widths
(260 / 264 / 244 / 232) once existed for one product because each shell picked
its own and nothing could move them together afterwards. When these five
anatomies were written, `260px` immediately reappeared in four files and
`280px` in three — `--tile-min`, `--panel-width`, `--list-column-min` and the
rest in `base.css` are what stop that becoming the next set of four widths, and
`check-tokens.mjs` fails the build on a new literal.

### 11.1 What must NOT diverge

Eleven anatomies is eleven products unless something is identical everywhere.
Anatomy is free. Vocabulary is not:

- **The Meridian bar** (§13.2) — same three answers, same order, same position.
- Tokens, and the rule that a colour never changes meaning between platforms.
- The six states (§ APP_FLOW §2), `DataTable`, form conventions, status-pill
  vocabulary, motion budget, ⌘K, and WCAG 2.2 AA.

A platform that invents a second nav list, a second stepper, or a second empty
state has not expressed an identity — it has forked the product.

## 12. Studio surfaces — the authoring design language

> Applies to every builder in the Developer Platform (P8): data objects, forms,
> advanced forms, flows, BPMN, rules, logic, queries, dashboards, custom UI, app
> composition, pages/web content, sites, ETL, API and mobile. **Thirteen
> builders, one frame.**

### 12.1 Why this section exists

Section 11 already said what a Studio surface should feel like — "low density,
maximum canvas area, prominent toolbars". The builders shared tokens and still
looked like thirteen separate products, because **layout was the part that was
diverging**: each builder invented its own rails, its own toolbar order, its own
error surface and its own idea of what publishing means. Tokens cannot fix that.
A frame can.

The frame is `@kannan19302/ui/studio` (`StudioShell`, `StudioToolbar`,
`StudioPalette`, `StudioCanvas`, `StudioInspector`, `StudioConsole`,
`PublishDiffDialog`, `useStudioDocument`). **A builder that renders its own
chrome is a defect**, in the same way a hardcoded hex is.

### 12.2 What we learned from the incumbents — and what we refused

Section 10 forbids being "a Frappe/SAP/Odoo skin". That is about *visual
language*, not about *interaction models*: Salesforce and SAP have spent twenty
years discovering which authoring gestures survive contact with real
administrators, and refusing to learn from that would be pride, not
originality. So we take the models and reject the surfaces.

| Source | Taken | Refused |
| :----- | :---- | :------ |
| **Salesforce** — Lightning App Builder, Flow Builder | Three-zone authoring (palette · canvas · inspector). The *element* metaphor with a typed property panel. "Activate" as a versioned act distinct from "Save". Debug-run with per-step inspection. Governor limits made visible to the author, not just enforced. | The blue rail and card-on-card density. The modal-heavy flows. The two-API problem, where the vendor's own tooling has privileges an external developer cannot get — our L4 invariant is the opposite. |
| **SAP** — Fiori, Build Apps | Flexible-column progressive disclosure: list → detail → inspector without losing context. The object-page anatomy for artefact detail. Explicit draft-versus-active state on every artefact. | The typography, the icon language, the grey grid. The assumption that density means crowding. |
| **This brief** (§§ 1–12) | All of it, unchanged. Tokens are still the law, seven themes × two densities still apply, WCAG 2.2 AA is still non-negotiable, six states are still mandatory, modal-on-modal is still forbidden. | — |

### 12.3 The four Studio rules

**Rule 1 — The canvas is the page.**
Chrome collapses; the artefact never does. At 1280px, with both rails open, the
canvas holds **at least 60% of the viewport**. The rail widths in
`tokens/studio.css` are chosen to meet that exactly (1280 − 232 − 280 = 768 =
60.0%), and `studio-shell.test.tsx` asserts the arithmetic — widen a rail and
the test fails, so the trade-off has to be made deliberately rather than by
accident.

Below `--studio-bp-inspector` the inspector collapses first (a property panel is
useless once the thing it edits is off screen); below `--studio-bp-palette` the
palette follows. Neither is ever *removed* — both stay reachable as labelled
handles, and a user who opens one at any width gets it. A breakpoint sets the
default; it never overrides a person.

**Rule 2 — The tool is visually distinct from the artefact.**
Studio chrome uses the `--studio-*` scale. Anything rendered *on* the canvas
uses the tenant's semantic tokens, because the canvas is showing the user what
their users will see. A builder control that looks like the thing being built is
how someone edits the wrong object. `tokens/studio.css` has always stated this
intent; §12 makes it a rule with a gate.

**Rule 3 — Five verbs, same order, same place, every builder.**

```
Validate · Preview · Test-run · Version · Publish
```

`StudioToolbar` fixes the order; a builder supplies handlers, never layout. A
verb a builder genuinely cannot perform renders **disabled with a stated
reason**, not hidden — so the bar has the same shape everywhere and nobody has
to re-find a control that moved. This is design law 3 ("learning one module must
teach you all 45") applied to the authoring surface.

**Rule 4 — Nothing publishes silently.**
Every publish path goes through `PublishDiffDialog`, which must show three
things before the button is live:

1. **What changes** — a diff against the currently live version, in the user's
   vocabulary ("Email field"), not a count and not `field[3]`.
2. **Where it goes** — the named environment, never implied.
3. **How to undo it** — the version this rolls back to.

A publish whose diff is empty is **refused**, not accepted as a no-op: a version
bump that changes nothing is how an audit trail fills with noise.

This is also how Track G's **G29** is enforced rather than promised. An
AI-generated artefact writes to the *draft* and becomes a reviewable change. No
AI output reaches a tenant's data without a person accepting a diff.

### 12.4 The shared interaction contract

- **Palette (left rail).** Searchable, grouped 5–7 per group (Miller's Law, §1).
  `/` focuses search, `↑↓` move, `Enter` inserts, `Esc` clears. **Drag is an
  accelerator, never the only path** — every item is a real `<button>`. Four
  builders shipped drag-only insertion via `@dnd-kit`, `@xyflow/react` and
  `react-grid-layout`, which is unusable without a pointer and fails §8.
- **Canvas (centre).** One selection model, owned by `StudioCanvas`:
  `Tab`/arrows traverse, `Esc` deselects, `Ctrl/Cmd+Z` undoes with visible
  history. Two variants — `linear` for list-shaped artefacts (forms, rules,
  queries), which keeps a bounded measure so fields stay readable, and `spatial`
  for flows, BPMN, pages and dashboards, which owns its full area and lets the
  embedded library keep its own zoom and pan.
- **Inspector (right rail).** Typed, schema-driven, tabbed
  `Properties · Logic · Style · Advanced`. **Never a modal** — editing a
  property is not a decision that needs the rest of the screen taken away; the
  canvas must stay visible so the author can see what their change did. Tabs a
  builder does not fill say so, rather than disappearing.
- **Console (bottom drawer).** `Problems · Output · Logs`. Collapsed by default
  (design law 4 — calm by default), with the error and warning counts on the
  collapsed bar so collapsing can never hide a failure, announced through
  `aria-live`. **A problem is actionable or it is not a problem**: every entry
  carries the id of the thing it is about and clicking it selects that thing on
  the canvas. "Invalid configuration" with nothing to click is not a validation
  message.
- **Six states everywhere.** `LoadingState`, `ErrorState`, `EmptyState`,
  `ForbiddenState` from `components/six-states.tsx`. No bespoke empty rendering.
- **Document state.** `useStudioDocument` — undo/redo, dirty tracking, draft
  autosave and a carried `baseVersion` so a stale write is rejected rather than
  silently clobbering a colleague's edit.

### 12.5 Accessibility, specifically for authoring

§8 applies in full. Three points that only arise on a canvas:

- The canvas is a real composite widget, not a `<div>` of draggable `<div>`s.
  `StudioCanvas` uses `role="group"` by default and `role="listbox"` **only when
  the builder genuinely renders `role="option"` children** — declaring `listbox`
  over arbitrary content is a lie a screen reader acts on, and `aria-required-children`
  catches it.
- **Every drag has a keyboard equivalent.** Insert from the palette with
  `Enter`; reorder on the canvas with the keyboard sensor. If an operation can
  only be performed by dragging, it is not finished.
- A custom page authored in the Studio passes the **same** `axe` and token gates
  as a first-party page (Track G **G17**). Bypassing them is not offered.

### 12.6 What a Studio surface must never do

- ❌ Render its own header, rails, toolbar or error surface instead of the shell.
- ❌ Put a property editor in a modal.
- ❌ Publish without a diff, or publish to an unnamed environment.
- ❌ Accept AI-authored content into a live artefact without a reviewed diff.
- ❌ Offer an operation that only works by dragging.
- ❌ Use `--studio-*` tokens for canvas content, or semantic tokens for chrome.
- ❌ Hide a validation failure behind a collapsed console with no count.

## 13. Meridian — the design language

> Established 2026-08-21. Ships as `[data-theme="meridian"]` /
> `[data-theme="meridian-dark"]` in `@kannan19302/ui`. Replaces `patina`, which
> was one app's private language and has been deleted.

### 13.1 Why the palette changed

§3.3 justified indigo `#6366f1` as reading "trustworthy and technical without
the *every SaaS product* blue". That claim no longer survives contact with the
market. Salesforce (`#0176D3`), SAP (`#0A6ED1`), Microsoft (`#0078D4`), Google
(`#1A73E8`) and Oracle all lead with a blue within a few degrees of hue of one
another; Odoo leads with an adjacent purple; and our indigo sat among them. A
buyer comparing six ERP screenshots was seeing one colour.

**Meridian's primary is neither blue nor purple.** It is a deep, desaturated
teal — `#0e6b75` light, `#48c5ce` dark — chosen to read as instrumentation
rather than as marketing, and it remains the only hue in the product that means
*you can click this*.

Three supporting decisions:

- **Inter stays** as the body and data face. It is correct at 14px, it has the
  tabular figures §4.1 requires, and ~785 files depend on its metrics. Swapping
  the workhorse buys a large visual regression and nothing else. Personality is
  carried by **Instrument Sans** (display, used only where something announces
  itself) and **Martian Mono** (machine-read text: addresses, ids, versions).
- **Warmth is quarantined, not absent.** `--brand-signal` (coral `#e4572e`)
  exists for marketing surfaces and empty-state illustration and is gated out of
  product CSS. The answer to "how do we attract a buyer" and the answer to "what
  does an eight-hour ledger screen feel like" are not the same answer.
- **Scope is a third colour axis** — `--scope-app|site|library|manage`. Scope
  says *where a thing lives*, status says *what state it is in*, the accent says
  *what is clickable*. Rendered as a 3px edge or hairline, **never a filled
  badge**. This is what stops eleven anatomies becoming a rainbow.

### 13.2 The signature — the Meridian bar

One component, identical on every surface, in the same position, answering three
questions in a fixed order:

```
acme / finance / invoices / INV-2043    ● Awaiting approval    [ Approve ]
└─ where am I (identity, mono) ─┘       └─ what state ─┘       └─ next verb ─┘
```

- **Left — address.** Identity, not navigation. A breadcrumb is where you have
  been; an address is the string you paste into a ticket. Rendered by
  `ArtifactAddress`, which keeps its rule that a null segment shows an em dash
  rather than collapsing the path.
- **Centre — state.** Exactly one status, in the shared pill vocabulary. Empty
  when nothing is pending — design law 4, calm by default.
- **Right — the next verb.** Exactly one primary action (§7). Disabled with a
  stated reason, never hidden.

No benchmark vendor has a single element spanning every surface of its suite.
This is where the boldness is spent; everything around it stays quiet.

**It ships as `MeridianBar`** (`design-system/src/shell/meridian-bar.tsx`), and
three of its rules are enforced rather than described:

- **One primary verb** is singular in the API — `action` is one object, not an
  array — because "exactly one primary per view" survives review pressure only
  if a second one cannot be expressed.
- **A disabled verb must state why**, and `MeridianAction` is a discriminated
  union so that `{ label, disabled: true }` is a *compile error*. §12.3 made
  this a rule for the Studio toolbar; here it is a type.
- **Height comes from `--meridian-bar-height`**, and `meridian-bar.test.tsx`
  reads the stylesheet to assert no literal replaced it. The "same position on
  every surface" claim fails silently otherwise, because each individual screen
  still looks right on its own.

The bar takes **either** a rendered `address` node or a plain `segments` list.
It does *not* widen `ArtifactAddress` to cover both, which was the original
plan: that component defends an invariant — a null project renders as an em dash
rather than collapsing, because a library artifact is exactly one whose
`ownerProjectId IS NULL` — and generalising it to also express
`finance / invoices / INV-2043` would have cost either the invariant or the
type. Two shapes, one bar, neither distorted to fit the other.

### 13.3 What we took from the incumbents, and what we refused

Same discipline as §12.2 — take interaction models proven over twenty years,
refuse the surfaces.

| Source | Taken | Refused |
| :----- | :---- | :------ |
| **Salesforce Lightning** | Object-page anatomy; the highlights panel's fixed answer to "what is this and what do I do with it". | Card-inside-card density; brand blue as the only accent; modal-heavy flows. |
| **SAP Fiori** | The flexible column layout — still the best list→detail→inspector model in enterprise software. Draft-vs-active on every artefact. | The grey grid, the icon font, the assumption that density means crowding. |
| **Odoo** | The view switcher (list · kanban · calendar · pivot) as a first-class control; inline-editable lists. | Per-module visual drift; the purple. |
| **Zoho** | Per-app identity within one suite. | Rainbow app-colour coding; chrome that changes meaning between apps. |
| **Microsoft Fluent 2** | The command bar; neutral discipline — one accent, everything else grey. | Acrylic blur; uniform rounding. |
| **Oracle Redwood** | Warmth; illustration that carries meaning in empty and onboarding states. | Consumer density on functional pages. |
| **Google Material 3** | Tonal elevation as the alternative to drop shadows in dark mode. | FAB, ripple, dynamic colour, Roboto. |

### 13.4 Geometry, motion, elevation

Nothing in the product is more rounded than 8px (`--radius-sm` 2px, `--radius-md`
4px on inputs and buttons); the editorial shell re-opens 16px inside its own
scope as a deliberate register change. Motion is faster than §6's marketing-era
scale — `--duration-normal` 150ms — because at 200ms a dropdown a clerk opens
four hundred times a day is felt as latency, not polish. **Dark mode carries
elevation by tone and hairline, never blur:** every `--shadow-*`/`--elevation-*`
collapses to a 1px ring, because a blurred black shadow on a dark ground is
invisible as depth and visible as smear.

### 13.5 The contrast gate

`design-system/scripts/check-contrast.mjs` runs as the first step of `build`. It
resolves every shipped theme's tokens as the browser would and fails on any pair
below its threshold (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large text and UI boundaries), plus a
chart-ramp check that adjacent series differ by ≥1.25:1 in luminance so the ramp
survives greyscale, print and colour-vision deficiency.

This exists because §3.5's "verified automatically in CI" was, until now, a
sentence rather than a mechanism — the only contrast code in the package checked
a *tenant's* runtime branding and never looked at the themes we ship ourselves.
The gate caught **20 real failures in Meridian's own first draft**, including a
ten-hue chart ramp whose every adjacent pair sat inside one luminance band.
