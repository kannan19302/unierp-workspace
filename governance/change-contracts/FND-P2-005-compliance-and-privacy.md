# Change Contract — FND-P2-005 Compliance and Privacy Readiness

## Cycle status

- Status: `DONE`
- Objective: enforce comprehensive retention and deletion policy coverage, PII classification registry, field-level encryption, and automated retention auditing across the estate.
- Risk class: `R1` — privacy, legal compliance, and regulatory data handling.
- Accountable platforms: Platform Governance and Business Services (`PLT-GOV`, `PLT-BIZ`).

## Architecture & Data Invariants

1. **Whole-Schema Retention Coverage**:
   - `check-retention-coverage.mjs`: All 1,973 models in the Prisma schema have an explicit lifecycle class:
     - 7 Retention-based (`RT`) models in `retention-matrix.json`.
     - 778 Soft-delete (`SD`) and Cascade-delete (`HD`) models.
     - 1,189 Documented and classified models in `scripts/retention-exemptions.json`.
     - **0 uncovered models**.
2. **Retention Architecture**:
   - `check-retention-architecture.mjs`: 1,785 active-estate files scanned; zero rogue retention implementations.
3. **PII Classification Registry**:
   - `check-pii-registry.mjs`: All 33 PII-carrying models documented and declared.
4. **Field-Level Encryption**:
   - `check-field-encryption.mjs`: AES-256-GCM envelope encryption, key rotation, and plaintext dump prevention.

## Verification Evidence

```bash
node scripts/check-retention-architecture.mjs
node scripts/check-retention-coverage.mjs
node scripts/check-pii-registry.mjs
node scripts/check-field-encryption.mjs
```
All compliance, privacy, and retention gates pass cleanly.
