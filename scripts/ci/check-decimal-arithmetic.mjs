/**
 * Decimal-arithmetic ratchet.
 *
 * Money is stored as `Decimal(19,4)` — the schema lint (check-schema-lints.mjs)
 * enforces that. But storage being exact is worthless if the arithmetic is not:
 * `entries.reduce((s, e) => s + Number(e.amount), 0)` pulls a Decimal column
 * into a JS binary float, sums it there, and writes the drifted result back to
 * a Decimal column. The value is exact at rest and wrong after every
 * recalculation.
 *
 * This gate counts those sites and fails if the count rises above the committed
 * baseline. Like the suppression ratchet, the baseline may only ever fall: fix
 * sites and lower it, never raise it.
 *
 * A site is counted when BOTH hold:
 *   1. the expression has the shape `<acc> + Number(<obj>.<field>)`, and
 *   2. `<field>` is declared `Decimal` somewhere in the Prisma schema.
 *
 * Condition 2 is what keeps this honest — summing a genuine Float metric
 * (a rate, a score, a sensor reading) through Number() is fine and is not
 * counted. Field names alone are not evidence; the schema is.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/ci/check-decimal-arithmetic.mjs           # check against baseline
 *   node scripts/ci/check-decimal-arithmetic.mjs --list    # print every site
 *   node scripts/ci/check-decimal-arithmetic.mjs --write   # lower the baseline

/* ── Polyrepo awareness — phase A30, defect D024/D025 ────────────────────────
 *
 * These were monorepo paths. `readdirSync` on the missing schema directory THREW
 * ENOENT, which is why the guard job failed after check-policy.mjs was fixed — the
 * same defect, one script along. Every gate inherited from the monorepo has it.
 *
 * POLICY_ROOT/POLICY_REPO let this run against a sibling repository's tree, the same
 * way check-policy.mjs does, so the gate travels to the code instead of guessing where
 * the code went. Where the schema is genuinely absent — as in unierp-workspace, which
 * holds no application source — the gate reports that it is DELEGATED rather than
 * throwing or, worse, reporting a clean zero.
