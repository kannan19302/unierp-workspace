/**
 * Every relative specifier a Node-loaded package emits must resolve the way
 * Node resolves it — not the way a bundler does.
 *
 * ── Why this gate exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * On 2026-08-06 the API did not boot. It exited during module load with
 * `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: packages/extension-api/dist/capabilities`, because
 * `src/index.ts` said `export * from "./capabilities"` and Node's ESM loader
 * requires the extension. `packages/contracts` had the same defect in three
 * specifiers.
 *
 * `pnpm verify` was 14/14 green through the whole failure, and this is the
 * point: the root tsconfig sets `moduleResolution: "bundler"`, so the compiler
 * was explicitly told to assume extensionless specifiers resolve, and it emits
 * them unchanged. The unit suites resolve through Vite. **Every gate in the
 * pipeline reads the code through a bundler, and the only consumer that does
 * not is the runtime.** No amount of typechecking can see this, by
 * construction.
 *
 * So the gate has to model Node's resolver rather than the compiler's. It reads
 * the emitted `dist/` — the artifact that actually loads — and checks each
 * relative specifier against the algorithm Node applies to it.
 *
 * ── What it deliberately does not check ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Packages consumed only by a bundler (`@unerp/ui`, `@unerp/framework` — Next.js
 * compiles both) are exempt: extensionless specifiers are correct there, and
 * failing them would be enforcing a rule their runtime does not have. The set
 * checked is derived, not listed: every `@unerp/*` package reachable through
 * `dependencies` from a Nest application, transitively.
 *
 * Deriving it matters. A hand-maintained list would go stale the first time a
 * package gains a dependency, which is exactly when the gate is needed.
