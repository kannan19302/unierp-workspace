/**
 * Single source for reading the Prisma schema, now that it is a multi-file
 * folder (R2 / ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW § F4).
 *
 * Five scripts previously opened `prisma/schema.prisma` directly. When the
 * schema was split into `prisma/schema/*.prisma` every one of them started
 * throwing ENOENT — including `check-schema-lints.mjs`, which is a CI gate.
 * A gate that crashes is worse than a gate that fails: it reports an error
 * that looks like tooling breakage, so it gets ignored rather than fixed.
 *
 * `readSchema()` concatenates every `.prisma` file in the folder, in a stable
 * order, and falls back to the legacy single file so the scripts keep working
 * on older branches and on `v1.0.0`.
